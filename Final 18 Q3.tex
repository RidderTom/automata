Let $w \in \sum*$ be arbitrary. We need to define a function $f$ such that $w \in A$ iff $f(w) \in B$.
In other words, we need to define a function $f$ such that $w \in A$ iff $f(w) = f(w)^R$.\\
I think the solution would be something like $f(w) = ww^R$ if $w \in A$ and ab if not.
However, this doesn't feel like a proper solution at all. I hope someone knows a better way...\\
I have seen the solution $f(w) = ww^R$ seen being proposed, but that would work only if A accepts every word in the alphabet.
